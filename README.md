# Social Media

## Bootcamp Challenge 18
> This challenge focusses on using MongoDB an Mongoose.  A database is built and from the command line, the challenge is to create, getAll, getById, update and delete Users and Thoughts, an create and delete Reactions and Friends.

>  I've gotten everything except the Friends routes working correctly.  My best guess is how I'm structuring how to create a Friend is Insomnia is not correct.


* The Assignment
  MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Over the last part of this course, you’ll use several of the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. Because the foundation of these applications is data, it’s important that you understand how to build and structure the API first.

  Your challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js (Links to an external site.) and Mongoose (Links to an external site.) packages, you may also optionally use a JavaScript date library of your choice or the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

  Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

### User Story
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data

### Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
